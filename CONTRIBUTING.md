# Contributing to Rows

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and 
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to change the public API, or make any non-trivial changes
to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue.
This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant
effort into it.

If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away
but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing.
This is helpful in case we don’t accept that specific fix but want to keep
track of the issue.

## Creating a Pull Request

Before creating a pull request please:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
1. Install all dependencies (`flutter pub get` or `pub get`).
1. Squash your commits and ensure you have a meaningful commit message.
1. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
   Pull Requests without 100% test coverage will not be approved.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. If you've changed the public API, make sure to update/add documentation.
1. Format your code (`dart format .`).
1. Analyze your code (`dart analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings  .`).
1. Create the Pull Request.
1. Verify that all status checks are passing.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your
pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional
design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately
accepted.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rows/automata/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
